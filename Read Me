Project completed with Dr. Sean Szumlanski @UCF Fall 2019

LonelyPartArray allocates and frees memory based off of a need-basis.

With the C programming language, you have the ability to allocate memory and save a lot of memory with your machine, which also 
decreases run time. This program was designed to be able to create and destroy memory based off of the input given to the program. Program
was made with a 2D-Array to be able to hold multiple values within a certain index of the array and each cell within the array.
